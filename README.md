This web-app contains a GANTT chart with some hard-coded data.
In order to run this application follow the below given commands:
1. After cloning cd to cloned folder and run npm i
2. After this simply run npm start 
Note: After running npm start if it shows some error such as module not found then run this command:
npm i @syncfusion/ej2-react-gantt
After this again run "npm start" and the web-app will be up and running on localhost:3000

The web-app simply displays a bar graph and the data in the table format.
If you will click on the bar graph then a modal will be displayed where you can modify the data as per your choice.
The modal consists of two sections:
1. General: Here you can change the startDate, endDate and TaskName. 
2. Custom: Here you can change the status of the task.

I have used the syncfusion library, particularly its Gantt component to implement this assignment.
